- Workflow Gaps
    - Communciation with/from api/cms team
      - As of now the communcation from the above teams leaves a lot to be desired. this is specially true regarding breaking changes.
      - Api/cms team should communicate breaking changes/etc to us and vice versa.
      - Action Items:
        - ?

    - Documentation
      - As of now the folder structure in the project has no documentation
      - As of now none of the logic on the mobile client is documented
        - This will be essential as we move forward with OneBuilder and other abstractions that we've added. Specially since we have new devs joining.
      - Action Items
        - Document new abstractions that we've added
          - OneBuilder
          - Smart reducers
          - Sagas
          - etc
        - Document our consulting company friend's legacy code (would be nice to do if we had infinite time)

    - Single source of truth for standards
      - As of now there is no single source of truth for standards
      - Standards should be documentated
      - There exists a standards document for the web client, however mobile client would benefit from keeping its own standards document
      - Action Items:
        - Decide on plan for documentating standards
        - Create standards document (or not based on action item above)

    - Code Review
      - As of now code review process is not being followed (obviously due to deadlines)
      - Need to ensure that code review comments are productive
      - [Great resource for ensuring that code review is productive ](https://mtlynch.io/human-code-reviews-1/#settle-style-arguments-with-a-style-guide)
      - [Part 2](https://mtlynch.io/human-code-reviews-2/#offer-sincere-praise)
        - TLDR:
          - Be proactive with examples
          - Criticize the work not the person
          - Tie comments to principles
            - "We should split this class in two"
            - vs
            - "We should split this class in two, because performance blah blah blah"
          - Phrase feedback as request not commands
            - Can we/Shouldnt this/Wouldn't a better way/etc
          - Prefer commenting on architecture over style
            - abstract style to a styleguide/linter

    - Linting
      - As of now no linting process in the project
      - No uniform style in the project
      - PRs sometimes littered with auto formatted code which makes it hard to review what actually was changed
      -
      - Action Items:
        - Decide on linting rules
        - Implement linter
        - Add linting to build pipeline
        - Optionally implement Prettier to abstract away having to manually fix lint issues

    - Testing
      - As of now none of the UI/logic is unit tested
      - As a result the UI/logic we're writing is not being written with testing in mind.
      - As a result UI/logic is brittle and is bound to have edge cases where bugs occur. This is specially true with a lot of the utility functions that are in the project (looking at you Iso... past consulting company)
      - Testing should ideally be part of story
      - Testing should ideally be done along side developement and not saved for the end
      - At a minimum utility functions/common components/other things we abstract away to reuse should be unit tested
      -
      - Action Items:
        - Decide on testing patterns
        - Decide on types of tests we want
